OVERVIEW:
This project implements a virtual memory simulator that translates logical addresses
to physical addresses using a TLB, page table, physical memory, and backing store.
Supports three page replacement algorithms: FIFO, LRU, and OPT.

DATA STRUCTURES:
- TLB: 16-entry Translation Lookaside Buffer with FIFO replacement
- Page Table: 256 entries tracking loaded pages and frame mappings
- Physical Memory: Variable frames (1-256), each 256 bytes
- FIFO Queue: Circular array for frame insertion order
- LRU Tracker: Access times for least recently used tracking
- Backing Store: 65,536-byte binary file containing all pages

PAGE REPLACEMENT ALGORITHMS:
FIFO: Evicts oldest loaded page using circular queue
LRU: Evicts least recently accessed page using access timestamps
OPT: Evicts page unused for longest time using lookahead (theoretical minimum)

ADDRESS TRANSLATION PROCESS:
1. Extract page number (8 bits) and offset (8 bits) from logical address
2. Check TLB for page-to-frame mapping
3. On TLB miss, check page table
4. On page fault: load from backing store, evict victim if needed
5. Update TLB and page table
6. Return physical address (frame * 256 + offset)

IMPLEMENTATION HIGHLIGHTS:
- Modular design with separate TLB, page table, and memory functions
- Two-pass processing for OPT algorithm (read addresses, then process)
- Global time counter for LRU access tracking
- Clean compilation with proper error handling and memory management

All test cases pass with expected page fault rates and TLB hit/miss counts.
